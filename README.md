# RocketSurgery

This cursed mod will make rocketry much more difficult. 

## features
- You must now build your rocket silo on-sight, in stages. Credits to https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Rocket-Silo-Construction
- The construction of rocket parts as well as the launch itself produces a wave of pollution, as well as a spike in electricity usage. 
- The silo's max health is reduced from 3000 to 1000.
- The silo no longer has any resistances.
- The silo is now a military target.

## demo

Seen here are 1 hour's worth of automated launches. Halfway, the mods was disabled. The "spikes" correspond to launch events and the "plataus" are the construction of the rocket.
